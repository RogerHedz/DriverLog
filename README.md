# DriverLog
A program I created for a course at the Mittuniversitetet university in Sundsvall/Ã–stersund in 2013.
It still has bugs...
Logs the car mileage and tracks (if you want) to a server of your own.

The strings are translated to english... Probably not correct. My native tounge is swedish.
Warnings:
If you increase the version number the database is emptied (easily changed in code)
I have not tested the english translation...

There is much room for improvement.

Development is irregular. 
If you use it or have suggestions or tips an email to rogerhedin (a) hotmail com is appreciated!
Great help by reading code from Big Brother GPS / Thanks
