# DriverLog
A program I created for a course at the Mittuniversitetet university in Sundsvall/Ã–stersund in 2013.
It still has bugs...
Logs the car mileage and tracks (if you want) to a server of your own.

Development is irregular. 
If you use it or have suggestions or tips an email to rogerhedin (a) hotmail com is appreciated!
Great help by reading code from Big Brother GPS / Thanks
